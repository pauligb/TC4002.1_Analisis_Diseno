## 1 – FIND THE NUMBER
### Description
Create a program invoked in the command line. It generates a random number between 1 and 30 (including 1 and 30). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. 

- Keep the game going until the user types “exit” or find the number
- Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print them out on console and in a file named GuessingSteps.txt

Name of the program: findNumber.py

### Practice
- Control structures
- Console Input output
- Saving into a file

### Test Cases and Evidence
- Record three runs


## 2 - CONVERTER
### Description
Create a command line program that take as input parameter a number and then it displays in the console the corresponding number (positive integers Plus Zero) in Binary and Hexadecimal. It also manages errors using exceptions for not using numbers.

Convert the number using the algorithm and not a function.

Name of the program: convert2X.py

### Practice
- Control structures
- Console Input output
- Error Handling

### Test Cases and Evidence
- Identify 10 test cases

## 3 – COUNT WORDS
### Description
Create a program that parses a file given as parameter and counts the number of occurrences for a list of words identified in the file. The identification is sensitive case.

Name of the program: findWords.py

### Practice
- Control structures
- Console Input output
- Error Handling
- String manipulation
- List usage

### Test Cases and Evidence
- Identify 3 test cases

## 4–Python Failing
### Description
You need to create two functions to substitute str() and int(). A function called int_to_str() that converts integers into strings, and a function called str_to_int() that converts strings into integers.

### Test Cases and Evidence
- Provide 10 test cases for each function

## 5-Profit
### Description
You work for a manufacturer, and have been asked to calculate the total profit made on the sales of a product. You are given a dictionary containing the cost price per unit(in dollars), sell price per unit(in dollars), and the starting inventory. Return the total profit made, rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Test Cases and Evidence
- Provide10 test cases
